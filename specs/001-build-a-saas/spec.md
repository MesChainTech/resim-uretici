	‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
	‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
	‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
	‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
	‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
	‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story

As an authenticated user, I want to generate a professional product/advertising image by combining my product photo with a model photo in a selected category, so that I can quickly produce marketing-ready visuals.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. Given the user is authenticated and on the generator, When they select a category and upload one model photo and one product photo, Then the Generate action submits the request and a loading state is displayed until a result or error is returned.
2. Given generation completes successfully within 5 minutes, When the response is received, Then the combined image is displayed on-screen and the user can download it as an image file.
3. Given the user is not authenticated, When they attempt to access the generator, Then they are redirected to sign in/sign up and cannot use the generator until authenticated.
4. Given no category is selected, When the user attempts to upload images or click Generate, Then the UI prevents the action and displays a clear, actionable message to select a category first.
5. Given only one image is uploaded, When the user clicks Generate, Then the system blocks submission and prompts the user to upload both a model and a product image.
6. Given the external processing takes longer than 5 minutes, When the timeout is reached, Then the system stops waiting and displays a timeout message with guidance to retry.
7. Given the external service returns an error or invalid image data, When the system processes the response, Then an error message explains the issue and offers a retry option.
8. Given the user is on a mobile device, When they use the landing and generator, Then all UI elements render responsively and remain accessible.

### Edge Cases

- Upload exceeds 10MB or unsupported format ‚Üí block upload with message indicating limits and allowed types.
- Duplicate clicks on Generate ‚Üí request is debounced or prevented until current processing completes.
- User navigates away mid-processing ‚Üí system cancels or warns that in-progress generation will be lost. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should processing continue server-side?]
- User navigates away mid-processing ‚Üí show a leave-warning. If the user confirms, the client cancels the request and stops waiting; any server-side processing already triggered is not retained or surfaced. The user must resubmit upon return.
- External service returns malformed/empty base64 ‚Üí show error and allow retry.
- Network interruption during request/response ‚Üí show connectivity error and retry guidance.
- Users attempt to upload images containing prohibited content ‚Üí block generation and inform the user. Prohibited content includes nudity/sexual content, hate symbols, graphic violence, illegal activities/drugs, or sensitive documents (IDs, credit cards). Display a brief policy notice.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements

- FR-001: The system MUST require users to authenticate before accessing the image generator.
- FR-002: The system MUST require users to select exactly one category prior to allowing uploads or generation; allowed categories: E-commerce, Fashion, Jewelry, Technology, Beauty.
- FR-003: The system MUST allow uploading exactly two images per generation: one model photo and one product photo.
- FR-004: The system MUST validate image constraints at upload: max size 10MB per file; allowed MIME types: image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp.
- FR-005: The system MUST display image previews for both uploaded files prior to generation.
- FR-006: The system MUST provide a Generate action that submits category and both images to an external processing service via a secure webhook-style request.
- FR-007: The system MUST show a visible loading state immediately after submission and maintain it until completion, error, or timeout.
- FR-008: The system MUST wait for a response for up to 5 minutes (300 seconds) and then treat the request as timed-out with an actionable message.
- FR-009: On successful response, the system MUST decode base64 image data and display the generated image within the UI.
- FR-010: The system MUST allow users to download the generated image as a PNG file. Default filename format: AI-Product-Image-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.png.
- FR-011: The system MUST present clear, human-readable error messages for validation failures, processing errors, network issues, and timeouts, along with suggested next steps.
- FR-012: The system MUST provide a "How to Use" section with concise steps describing the process from category selection through download.
- FR-013: The system MUST include a landing page with Header, Hero (generator interface), How to Use, Pricing, and Footer sections.
- FR-014: The system MUST ensure the UI is responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.
- FR-015: The system MUST conform to accessibility practices such that all critical actions are operable via keyboard, have proper labels, and meet contrast requirements aligned with WCAG 2.1 AA. Acceptance: keyboard-only navigation reaches all controls in a logical order; visible focus is present; images have alternative text; color contrast ‚â• 4.5:1 for text; form controls and buttons have accessible names; error messages are programmatically associated and announced by assistive tech; a basic screen-reader smoke test (e.g., reading primary flows) passes.
- FR-016: The system MUST transmit data to the external processing service over HTTPS and avoid exposing sensitive URLs or tokens in client-visible contexts. External service access MUST be authenticated using server-managed credentials; no secrets are stored or exposed in the client.
- FR-017: The system MUST prevent multiple submissions while a generation is in progress (disable or debounce the Generate action).
- FR-018: The system SHOULD allow the user to cancel an in-progress generation and reset the UI. Cancellation stops waiting and re-enables inputs; any in-flight processing result, if completed later, is discarded/not surfaced.
- FR-019: The system SHOULD avoid persisting user-uploaded and generated images beyond what is necessary for processing and display unless retention is explicitly defined. Policy: images (uploads and generated) are not stored server-side after processing completes; they are retained only for the active session to display and download, with no long-term storage.

### Key Entities

- User: An individual who authenticates to access the generator; attributes include identity, authentication state, and basic profile.
- Category: One of the predefined values (E-commerce, Fashion, Jewelry, Technology, Beauty); required selection per generation.
- Image Upload: User-provided file designated as either Model Photo or Product Photo; attributes include type (model/product), file size, format, and preview.
- Generation Request: A user-initiated submission combining category and two inputs; attributes include createdAt, status (awaiting, processing, completed, failed, timed-out), and an optional error reason.
- Generated Image: The output returned as base64-encoded image data; attributes include display preview and downloadable file.
- External Processing Service: An external system that accepts the request and returns the generated image; bound by a 5-minute response expectation and secure transport.
